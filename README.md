Most hunters still do everything manually. Read contracts in a browser, grep from memory, rewrite Foundry templates each hunt, draft reports from scratch.

These skill files load into Claude Code (or any AI) and give it a complete smart contract security knowledge base - target scoring, bug patterns, grep arsenal, PoC templates, report format, and real case studies. One `claude` command, then start hunting.

Works with: **Claude Code**, **Claude.ai**, **Cursor**, **any AI that reads files**.

## The 10 Bug Classes

```
01  Accounting Desync    →  most common Critical (37% of all payouts)
02  Access Control       →  most common High
03  Incomplete Path      →  missing modifier on a sibling function
04  Off-by-One           →  boundary operators, index errors
05  Oracle Price         →  TWAP manipulation, stale prices
06  ERC4626 Vaults       →  share inflation, rounding attacks
07  Reentrancy           →  cross-function, cross-contract, read-only
08  Flash Loan           →  price manipulation, economic attacks
09  Signature Replay     →  cross-chain replay, missing nonce/chainId
10  Proxy/Upgrade        →  uninitialized implementation, storage collision
```

> Read ALL sibling functions. If `vote()` has a modifier, check `poke()`, `reset()`, `harvest()`.
> The missing modifier on the sibling is the bug. This one rule explains 19% of all Criticals.

## Setup

**Option 1 - drop into your existing project:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awarexone/web3-bug-bounty-hunting-ai-skills.git .claude/skills/web3
claude
```

Then in Claude Code:
```
Read all files in .claude/skills/web3/ starting from 00-START-HERE.md
```

**Option 2 - standalone workspace:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awarexone/web3-bug-bounty-hunting-ai-skills.git
cd web3-bug-bounty-hunting-ai-skills
claude
```

**Option 3 - just the essentials:**
```
Read 02-bug-classes.md and 04-poc-and-foundry.md
```
